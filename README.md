# Organizing-a-Successful-Kickstarter-Campaign-with-Data-Analysis
In this project, we develop two machine learning models to assess the likelihood of a Kickstarter campaign reaching its fundraising goal and to help it improve its chances of success. 

The first model is a classification model to predict whether a fundraising campaign will be a success or failure based on the characteristics of the campaign (target amount, country of origin, event category).

The second model is a clustering algorithm to determine how many days a fundraising campaign should last to reach its target amount.

Please refer to the "Project Report" to learn more about the final solution, development methodology and findings.
